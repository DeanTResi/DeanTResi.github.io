      <h2>Computing</h2>
      <span><em>Back in the day... Computers were a luxury.</em></span>
      <p>
        But luckily I got my hands on an old mac which someone threw into a skip. Fully working, black and white, probably worth a lot of money now had i kept it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was my first experience with computers, and I would sit there making pixel art on the shoddy 300x200 resolution or whatever it was <em>for hours</em>, totally amazed. Since then I always managed to find myself a beat up old computer from someone, my favourite of which was a Commadore64. When I got older my mum learned to repair computers and the rest was history. By then we had the brickphones and the motorola razr and everything else we consider outdated now. Good times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, I'm fixing computers, building computers, upgrading computers, and also doing a lot of shit on computers. I really got into games programming and game design more than 10 years ago. I worked on a few personal and collaborating projects and then adult life got in the way as expected, you can see some of my work in the gallery below!

      <!-- <img src="images/me.jpg" class="img-circle" alt="Dean Tresadern"> -->
      <span>I am passionate about arts and crafts, I've always loved drawing and painting, but my drawing skills far outmatch my painting skill.</span>
      <hr>
      <p>
          I am pretty good at making just about anything using anything, and can whip up a mean diagram when things get serious. But in addition to that, I do love to produce artwork (mostly on a computer nowadays) and work on crafts projects with my daughter. I've dabbled with many things from traditional painting, digital painting, graphic design, model making, jewellery making, acrylic pouring, acrylic forming, 3D printing and more...

      <h2>Making & Tinkering</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/me.jpg" class="img-circle" alt="Dean Tresadern"> -->
      <span>I'm a mechanic/engineer at heart and grew up on meccano, lego technic and matchstick models.</span>

      <p>
        One of my favourite things to do since I was a child is to pull something apart to figure out how it works and then put it back together. I've always been a knowledge seeker and if something doesnt make sense to me, I try my damndest to figure it out. I'm super useful around the house and fixing bikes!<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        This pattern is reflected in my numerous hobbies and my job history. I'm a qualified bicycle mechanic, entirely self-taught, and also worked as a drainage engineer for some time. One of my favourite hobbies is also 3D-printing (I have three of them!) I love to reverse engineer and create my own products or make little 3d printed things for friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also somewhat skilled in electronics (hobbyist level) and also forming and working with acrylic - I used these skills to build an enclosure for my pet and a fish tank.

        <strong>I've endured more than a week without a single hour of sleep.</strong> This might not sound very impressive (and it isnt, its awful) but involuntary Insomnia is no fun and no joke, and nobody could ever figure out what caused it. I managed to recover back to a normal sleep pattern and as a bonus, my sanity is intact! But there were hallucinations and distortions of reality.... ðŸ‘€ I've been into the matrix.

        <strong>I've had at least six motorcycle accidents and sustained zero injuries and/or landed on my feet.</strong> I should point out that this has been a mix of both low and high speed, in numerous settings. <em>Either I'm the terminator or just super lucky.</em> In any case I havent ridden in some time as the last accident wrote off my motorcycle and so it's now a glorified backyard decoration.

        <strong>It's nothing too crazy but I have a pet snail.</strong><br>A giant african land snail or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissachatina_fulica" target="_blank">Lissachatina fulica</a> if you want to get all scientific.
      </p>
      <p>
        While many are grossed out by snails (especially the crunch if you happen to step on one), It's no less gross than a pet insect or lizard, or maybe slimer from the Ghostbusters.
      </p>
      <p>
        They can live around 4-5 years in captivity and their shells alone can grow up to 10cm which is pretty damn big for a snail. They are extremely low maintenance (Ideal for someone like myself who used to work 6 days a week) but have a veracious appetite. In fact, they are considered a <a href="https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/terrestrial/invertebrates/giant-african-snail" target="_blank">highly invasive species</a> and are illegal in many countries. Snails can breed like crazy and this particular species has little in the way of natural predators in the UK, if a swam of these slimy suckers were let loose it would probably be catastrophic and categorised as a terrorist attack. Every garden, vegetable patch, flower or plant in the vicinity would be devoured.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite their poor reputation, my daughter is fascinated by it, and on the odd occasion it does some hilarious shit that ive never seen a 'normal' snail do. It's suprisingly friendly, appears to have 'learned' that I am not a predator. Also my snail is fussy and refuses to eat anything other than cucumber. Which I find odd, I didnt realise a snail could be fussy.
